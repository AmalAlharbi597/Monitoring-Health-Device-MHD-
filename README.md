# Monitoring-Health-Device-MHD-
Monitoring Health Device (MHD) is a smart system designed to monitor the health of patients, particularly the elderly and those with chronic diseases.The device measures vital signs and sends alerts when critical conditions are detected, notifying doctors, family members, or nearby hospitals. The goal of this project is to enhance healthcare monitoring and reduce risks associated with delayed medical intervention.

üö® Note:
This repository contains the analytical steps for the development phases of the project, including requirement gathering, planning, and system analysis. It is not the final executable version of the software. The implementation phase will follow based on these analyses.



üöÄ Planned Features
Continuous Monitoring: Tracks vital signs such as heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and body temperature.
Alerts & Notifications: Sends instant alerts in case of critical health conditions.
Appointment Reminders: Notifies patients about their scheduled medical appointments.
Health Reports: Provides statistical health reports for patients and doctors.
Hospital Integration: Enables hospitals and doctors to receive patient data in emergency situations.
Multi-User Support: Allows patients, doctors, and family members to access health updates.






üîç Initial Analysis:
Identifying the problem and the need for this device.
Gathering information from patients, doctors, and healthcare experts.
Analyzing potential challenges and proposing solutions.
 
 
 
 üìù System Design & Specifications:
